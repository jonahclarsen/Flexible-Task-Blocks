# Flexible Time Blocks
A simple program for blocking time and quickly offsetting blocks based on when one starts.

I built this because I wanted to start time blocking but I wake up at a different time every day, and I didn't want to have to drag every time block on my calendar to a different time depending on when I woke up (or if certain things go long or short).

It's not meant as a standalone productivity tool - I still use my favourite Notes app to plan the tasks - but it's very useful for calculating how long my day will take given the planned task blocks.
