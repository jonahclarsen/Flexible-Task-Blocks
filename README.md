# Flexible Time Blocks
A simple program for blocking time and quickly offsetting blocks based on when one starts.

I built this because I wanted to start time blocking but I wake up at a different time every day, and I didn't want to have to drag every time block on my calendar to a different time depending on when I woke up (or if certain things go long or short).

It's not meant as a standalone productivity tool - I still use my favourite Notes app to plan the tasks - but it's very useful for calculating how long my day will take given the planned task blocks.

## How to use
It's just one self-contained HTML page. The tasks you create are saved via the browser's Web Storage API, and so will persist in your browser's storage until they're cleared it from Developer Settings.

I've only tested it on a Chromium-based browser on Mac but I would expect it to work on all platforms.
